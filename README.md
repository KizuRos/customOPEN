Custon OpenTSDB sink for flume.

## NOW ##

What we have:

- An exec source using tail command to get data from /var/log/messages
- A sink which manages to get data from channel and printing to the console



What we want:

- Send data from custom flume sink to OpenTSDB living in a remote host.


P.S. New repository with full maven project resolving all dependencies
     including conf files for flume is on the WAY!!
